Project Objectives: 
- Fetching forecasting weather data through the API, processing it, and presenting it in a visually compelling way. This involves understanding the API response, handling data in Python, and preparing it for visualization. 
- Create an interactive web application that empowers the users to explore and personalize their weather data visualization. 
- Making the dataset clear to viewers with data visualization. Presenting the data in a way that is easily comprehensible and visually compelling. 

API: Open Weather Map: Weather Service https://openweathermap.org/

OpenWeather is a comprehensive weather API that offers a wide range of weather data, including current conditions, recasts, historical data, and more. It provides various weather parameters, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. 

Features: 
- Utilize OpenWeather API to retrieve diverse weather parameters(temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation)
- Use `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Python` to structure and style the web application. 
- Ask the user for input. This could involve allowing users to select specific locations, time frames, or weather parameters they are interested in. 
- Use of libraries like `matplotlib` or `plotly` to create graphs and maps illustrating weather patterns. 
- Use graphical context in maps to illustrate variations effectively. Ensure the user interface is intuitive.  
- Save the generated maps to an HTML file to enable the user to revisit and share specific visualizations.
